Welcome to the ben.coffee HyperDev page
============================

My website is hosted on HyperDev, so if you want you edit the files here and they will show up in real time a https://ben.coffee

Indeed, I invite you to do so. If I don't like it I will restore from backup. :)


Your Project
------------

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
